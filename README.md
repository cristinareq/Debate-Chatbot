# Debate-Chatbot

This repository will be used for the chatbot and reccomender final project. 

BUSINESS PROBLEM:

The technological age has forevermore changed society through its ability to connect and disconnect people. This becomes especially obvious through watching how modern media has the ability to polarize a population by omitting some pieces of information while emphasizing others. 

Today’s world is filled with information and misinformation alike. This can make it difficult for someone to properly inform themselves on an issue that intrigues them. 

A significant portion of human interaction happens through comment replies and threads thanks to the widespread usage of social media, and this format of “conversation” differs greatly from how people interact beyond a screen. This comment-replies-to-comment method of sharing information through online “debates” impacts how people perceive and digest information. 

The aforementioned change in how people may interact with those that have opinions which differ from their own can make a person less inclined to sit with new ideas and facts.

People that want to learn how to navigate ideas which are different from their own may not have the ability to join a debate team or meet up with peers just to have discussions and share ideas. 

WHAT WE WANT TO BUILD:

Sophisticated debate simulator that allows a user to learn about ideas which differ from their own through the presentation of different arguments, facts, and fallacies.

Interactive chatbot that can remember its conversations with a user and keep track of what the user is trying to explore. 

Education tool appropriate for anyone that wants to understand a perspective different from their own.
